            <h3>How Do Trees Reduce Global Warming?</h3>
            <p>The carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere have been rising.  This traps extra heat in our atmosphere and creates an effect called global warming.  Trees break down carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen and storing carbon. This gives us the oxygen we need and cools the planet.</p>

            <h3>How Else do Trees Help the Earth?</h3>
            <p>Trees provide food and shelter to animals and humans.  They create shade which cools the air.  Trees also release water vapor into the atmosphere, and in large numbers they create clouds which provide us with rain.  Trees even have a beneficial effect on our emotional state.  Let's all show our gratitude by planting some trees!

            <h3 >Planting Guidelines</h3>
            <p>If you would like to plant a tree on your property, I would recomend using a potted tree rather than a bare root tree, so that it will have a better chance of survival.  Each type of tree has it's own soil, water and sunlight preferences, so be sure to check those before you begin.  <br><br>Dig your hole to the depth of the roots of the tree.  It is fine to dig the hole wide but be sure not to dig it too deep.  You can amend the soil with organic matter if your tree prefers acidic soil.  Plant the tree and saturate it with water.  You may put mulch around the tree, but be sure not to let the mulch touch the trunk.  <br><br>Water your tree daily for two or three weeks and for the next few months you can water it every two or three days.  Enjoy your new tree!

    <p>For those of us who would like to plant trees with a group, there are many options. Here are some nonprofits that work at a national or global level:</p>
    <p><strong>One Tree Planted</strong> is an amazing international organization.  They will plant trees for you if you give a little donation, or you can use other peoples donations to plant the trees with a team.  Brilliant!  Check it out here: <a href="https://onetreeplanted.org/" target=_blank>onetreeplanted.org</a>.
